Alas
 poor Yorick
 I knew him
 Horatio
 a fellow of infinite jest
of most excellent fancy
 he hath borne me on his back a thousandtimes
 and now
 how abhorred in my imagination it is
 my gorge rimsat it
 Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft
Where be your gibes now
 your gambols
 your songs
 your flashes ofmerriment
 that were wont to set the table on a roar
 Not one now
to mock your own grinning
 quite chap
fallen
Now get you to my lady
s chamber
 and tell her
 let her paint aninch thick
 to this favour she must come
 make her laugh at that
